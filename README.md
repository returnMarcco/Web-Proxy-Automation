A batch script to help you get those notorious 3 average viewers :)

Instruction List  
================ 
Script Preparation:
* Download the attached script (stream_proxy_automation)
* Step 1) Open this script in a text editor (notepad for example). This is the first step.  
* Step 2) Replace all instances of "insert your Twitch URL here" with YOUR Twitch channel's URL. DO NOT REMOVE the {ENTER} next to the URL.   
Format Example: %SendKeys% "https://twitch.tv/newLifePlus{ENTER}"

*Note: The script uses Chrome browser by default. If you would like to use this script with another browser, replace all instances of "CHROME" with your browser of choice. You may have to Google the Batch Scripting Language syntax for the particular browser you would like to use.

* Step 3) Save and close the script file.  

To Use - IMPORTANT: START YOUR LIVESTREAM BEFORE RUNNING THIS SCRIPT  

Simply run the script file. A CMD window should open. Let it do it's thing. Once the window closes, you should see your view count increase within a short period of time.  


If this helped you, consider leaving a follow on both of my Twitch (https://twitch.tv/returnMarcco) & YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1aPOXPpMAKbPOT0Hw1GbMg) channels.
